                            <p>The goods are fed in at an even, set rate. A controlled screw conveyor
                                transports the goods inside the blancher in order to achieve consistent
                                quality. The product is discharged on the face side by a ferris wheel. This
                                ensures consistent transport as well as a consistent blanching time. The
                                speed can be set with a speed-controlled motor.</p>
                                <p>The water is heated by steam heating in the venturi nozzle. Water cycle with
                                water inlet on the outlet end and water drain on the inlet side, both on the
                                face of the delivery points.</p>
                                <p>The temperature is measured before and after the venturi valve. The flow
                                rate can be set manually with a manual shutoff valve.</p>
