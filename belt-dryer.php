                            <p>The Belt Dryer is designed for continuous and uniform drying of vegetables, fruits, and other food products in large-scale processing lines. It ensures efficient moisture removal while maintaining product quality, texture, and nutritional value.</p>

                            <p>The system operates using a multi-layer conveyor belt mechanism where hot air circulates evenly across the product surface. Controlled temperature, airflow, and belt speed allow precise drying performance tailored to different products and production capacities.</p>

                            <p>Constructed from high-grade food-safe stainless steel, the Belt Dryer offers hygienic operation, energy efficiency, easy cleaning, and low maintenance. It is ideal for applications such as French fries processing, dehydrated vegetables, and various snack production lines.</p>

                            <p>The modular design allows customization based on capacity requirements, ensuring reliable performance and seamless integration with upstream and downstream processing equipment.</p>
