                            <p>The Destoning And Washing is specially designed to remove stones, sand, mud, and other heavy impurities from vegetables and root crops while ensuring thorough cleaning. It plays a critical role in protecting downstream equipment and improving overall product quality.</p>

                            <p>The system operates using a combination of controlled water flow, agitation, and gravity separation. Heavier particles such as stones settle at the bottom and are discharged separately, while the cleaned produce moves forward for further processing.</p>

                            <p>Manufactured from high-quality food-grade stainless steel, the machine ensures hygienic operation, efficient water usage, easy maintenance, and reliable performance in continuous food processing lines.</p>
