                            <p>The Fat Separator in the French Fries Processing Line is engineered to effectively remove
                                excess surface oil from freshly fried French fries. By separating residual oil after the
                                frying stage, it enhances product crispiness, improves texture, and ensures consistent
                                final quality.</p>

                            <p>Using a controlled draining and oil recovery system, the unit efficiently collects excess
                                oil and redirects it back to the frying system for reuse. This not only minimizes oil
                                consumption but also reduces operational costs and improves overall line efficiency.</p>

                            <p>Constructed from high-grade food-safe stainless steel, the Fat Separator is designed for
                                hygienic operation, corrosion resistance, and easy maintenance. Its robust structure
                                ensures reliable performance in continuous, high-capacity French fries production lines.
                            </p>

                            <p>The system can be customized based on production capacity and layout requirements, making
                                it suitable for small, medium, and large-scale French fries manufacturing plants.</p>
