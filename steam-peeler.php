                            <p>A conveyor system is used to feed the de-stoned and washed goods to the steam
                                peeler scale. The two unloading flaps open when the set weight is reached, with a
                                delay to counter bridging. Peeling in the pressure vessel takes place at a steam
                                pressure of 16 bar.</p>
                            <p>Fast opening times and the large diameter of the steam release valves optimize peel
                                release during expansion.</p>
                            <p>The double-walled container ensures that the incoming steam spreads quickly and
                                evenly throughout all the goods, which decreases the steam peeling time
                                significantly.The condensate collects in the intermediate floor.
                            </p>
                            <p> The product does not come into contact with the condensate at any time during the
                                peeling process. This allows for a further reduction in peeling times and peeling
                                losses.
