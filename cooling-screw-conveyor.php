                            <p>The Cooling Screw Conveyor is designed to efficiently reduce the temperature of hot processed products before further handling or packaging. The product is gently conveyed through a screw mechanism inside a cooling trough, ensuring uniform heat dissipation.</p>

                            <p>The system can be equipped with water-cooled or air-cooled jackets to maintain consistent cooling performance. Its controlled conveying speed ensures optimal retention time for effective cooling without damaging the product structure.</p>

                            <p>Constructed with food-grade stainless steel, the Cooling Screw Conveyor ensures hygienic operation, easy cleaning, and reliable performance in continuous processing lines.</p>
