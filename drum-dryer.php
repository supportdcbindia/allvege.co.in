                            <p>The Drum Dryer is designed for efficient drying of purees, pastes, and slurry-based food products. The product is applied as a thin film onto the surface of a rotating heated drum, where moisture rapidly evaporates.</p>

                            <p>As the drum rotates, the dried product is continuously scraped off by a knife system, producing uniform flakes or powder. The process ensures controlled drying conditions, preserving product quality, color, and nutritional value.</p>

                            <p>Manufactured from high-grade stainless steel, the Drum Dryer ensures hygienic operation, energy efficiency, and reliable performance for continuous industrial production.</p>
