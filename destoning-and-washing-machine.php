                            <p>The Destoning & Washing Machine is designed to efficiently remove stones, sand, and heavy impurities from fruits and vegetables while ensuring thorough cleaning. The system operates using controlled water flow and agitation to separate heavier particles from the product.</p>

                            <p>Stones and debris settle at the bottom and are discharged separately, while the cleaned produce moves forward through the washing section for further processing. This dual-function system enhances product quality and protects downstream equipment from damage.</p>

                            <p>Manufactured from food-grade stainless steel, the machine ensures hygienic operation, easy maintenance, and reliable performance in continuous processing lines.</p>
